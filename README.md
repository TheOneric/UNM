# UNM
I tried to port/rewrite my Mod for MC 1.10+ with the new json-block models and all the other changes since 1.6.4, but it turned out to be more work, and json-Block-Models to be more annoying, than anticapated. Due to lack of time this endeavour was given up after a few months.
I'll leave it here in case someone with more time, can use this in conjunction with the full, finished version for Minecraft Release 1.6.4, which can be found here: https://github.com/TheOneric/UNM_1.6.4

```
The Ultimate Nether Mod for Minecraft 1.10.

This mod is currently being rewritten from scratch adding and changing some features and updating to Minecraft 1.10.
In it's current state it is far, really far, away from being complete or even a beta status.
